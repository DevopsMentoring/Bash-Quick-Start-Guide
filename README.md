## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
#!/bin/bash
printf 'Starting script\n' >> log
printf 'Creating test directory\n' >> log
mkdir test || exit
printf 'Changing into test directory\n' >> log
cd test || exit
printf 'Writing current date\n' >> log
date > date || exit
```
